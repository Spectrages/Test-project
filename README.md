##  Downloading project files

To run the project, you need to call the command **gh repo clone Spectrages/Test-project** to clone the repository on your computer.<br/>
If you do not have a **github CLI** installed, you can download the project by clicking on the **DOWNLOAD ZIP** button.<br/>

##  Installing dependencies

After you get the project files, go to the **/server** folder and call the command **npm install**.<br/>
Repeat this operation for the **/client** folder.<br/>

##  Launch of the project

After successfully installing all the dependencies, go to the **/server** folder and run the **npm run start:dev** command.<br/>
You should receive a message that the server has successfully started on port 5000 and the MongoDB database is connected.

The next step is to launch the client side of the application. Go to the **/client** folder and run the command **npm start**.
